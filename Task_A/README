Internship task - A
Recently we organized running competition for our developers. Everyone saw that James won.
But nobody noticed who finished the run on second place.
Fortunately, we have logs with names and positions. The problem is that there were thousands of runners and we need you
to write a program that can find a runner-up for us.
