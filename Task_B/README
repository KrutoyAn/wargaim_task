Internship task - B
Letâ€™s play a game with numbers. You are given sequence of numbers 1...n and a number x = 3.
Every round you will remove from the sequence numbers that fulfils following two conditions:

1. number is divisible by x
2. number contains digit sum of x

To get digit sum of number x you keep summing single digits until you get single digit number.
For example: digit_sum(56) => 5+6 = 11 => 1+1 = 2
Initial value of x = 3. Amount of removed numbers will be your x for next round.
Game ends when you remove 0 numbers (x==0).
